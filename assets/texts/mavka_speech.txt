Thou art correct; I have not been human for many a year. 
Initially, I sought to prevent thee from being one as well, yet I have grown quite fond of thee. 
Therefore, I shall present thee with a riddle. 
Shouldst thou succeed in solving it, I shall divert three mortals or spirits from thy path, that they may not trouble thee. 
However, shouldst thou err, I shall do as I intended from the very beginning!
